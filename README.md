# Projekt_Shaderschmiede
This program is used to simplify basic HLSL shader creation, for example when trying out basic shader concepts and thus needing to rewrite a lot of the same code with minor changes.

To-Dos:
1. Update readme for better description and instructions
2. Implement more features to add to the shader
3. Rework some of my old, janky code ;)
4. Maby add an option to read and alter a file (I don't know how to prevent loss of information and functionality yet so this might take a while)
